## Introduction
"DP" is the official abbreviation for "demerit point." It represents a unit of disciplinary measure employed within educational institutions to signify instances of student misconduct or rule violations. Assigned by educators or administrators, demerit points serve as a quantitative indicator of behavioral infractions, with each point denoting a specific transgression. These points are accrued by students over the course of an academic year and are instrumental in monitoring and addressing disciplinary issues within the school community.

## Background
### Here is a conversation between me and Morandi Andy Sun.

> **Andy:** Damn it, I got 11 demerit points for not folding my quilt. What can I say?

**Me:** How many DPs you accumulated until now?

> **Andy:** <u>I don't even know how many DPs I have.</u>
>
> **Andy:** I get DPs every month, but <u>I can't exactly remember the day and the reasons.</u>

**Me:** Why don't you ask your teacher?

> **Andy:** I tried, <u>she said she doesn't know either</u>
>
> **Andy:** Sometimes they give the wrong DP to me; <u>it takes ages for teachers to cancel it,</u> and it's <u>hard to find a teacher to have a talk</u>.
>
> **Andy:** It would be better if there were graphs and statistics, and DPs could be appealed.

> **Andy:** You should make a new DP system for us.
